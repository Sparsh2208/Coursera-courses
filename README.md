##  <a href="google.com"> Coursera Courses Repository </a>
Welcome to my Coursera courses repository! Here, you'll find all the materials I've collected while completing various online courses on Coursera. This includes lecture slides, assignment descriptions, code snippets, and any other materials provided by the course instructors.

## Organization


The repository is organized by course name and week number, making it easy to find the materials you need. Each course folder contains subfolders for each week, and within those folders you'll find the relevant materials.

## Collaboration


I'm open to collaborations or feedback from fellow learners. If you're interested in working together or have any suggestions for improving this repository, please feel free to reach out.
